In Python, the code you write is first broken down into smaller elements called **tokens**, which are processed by the Python interpreter.  \n","\n","Think of **lexical structure** like the **alphabet and grammar** of a language—just as we need letters, words, and punctuation to form sentences in English, Python needs **characters, tokens, keywords, and other elements** to form valid code.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Character Set in Python**  \n","\n","A **character set** is the collection of symbols, letters, and numbers that Python recognizes.  \n","\n","Python supports:  \n","-  **Letters:** `A-Z`, `a-z`  \n","-  **Digits:** `0-9`  \n","-  **Special Characters:** `+ - * / % = < > ( ) { } [ ] , . : ;`  \n","-  **Whitespace:** Spaces, tabs, and newlines  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Lexical Units (Tokens) in Python**  \n","\n","A **token** is the smallest meaningful unit of a Python program. Every piece of code you write consists of tokens.  \n","\n","**Types of Tokens:**  \n","1. **Keywords** – Reserved words in Python.  \n","2. **Identifiers** – Names for variables, functions, etc.  \n","3. **Punctuators** – Symbols like operators and delimiters.  \n","4. **Literals (Constants)** – Fixed values such as numbers or strings.  \n","5. **Whitespace** – Spaces, tabs, and newlines used for readability.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **1. Keywords in Python**  \n","\n","**Keywords** are reserved words that have a specific meaning in Python. They **cannot** be used as variable names.  \n","\n"," **Analogy:** Think of keywords like **traffic signals**—each has a specific function, and you must follow the rules!  \n","\n","**Example:**  \n","```python\n","if True:\n","    print(\"This is a keyword example!\")\n","```\n","\n","**List of Some Python Keywords:**  \n","`False`, `None`, `True`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, `else`, `elif`, `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `def`, `return`, `class`, `import`, `try`, `except`, `finally`, `with`, `as`  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2.

Augmented Assignment (Compound Operators)**  \n","\n","Python provides **augmented assignment operators** for performing operations and assignment in a single step.  \n","\n","| **Operator** | **Example** | **Equivalent To** |\n","|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n","| `+=` | `x += 5` | `x = x + 5` |\n","| `-=` | `x -= 2` | `x = x - 2` |\n","| `*=` | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |\n","| `/=` | `x /= 4` | `x = x / 4` |\n","| `//= ` | `x //= 2` | `x = x // 2` |\n","| `**=` | `x **= 2` | `x = x ** 2` |\n","| `%=` | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` |\n","\n","#### **Example:**  \n","```python\n","x = 10\n","x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5\n","print(x)  # Output: 15\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **5. Unpacking Assignment**  \n","\n","Python allows **unpacking values** from lists or tuples into multiple variables.  \n","\n","#### **Example:**  \n","```python\n","\n","a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]  # Assigns 1 to a, 2 to b, and 3 to c\n","print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3\n","```\n","```python\n","b,c,d = 10,20,30    # Multiple Assignment\n","e,f,g = 10,'A',True # Multiple Assignment\n","*b,c,d =

= 25  # Not descriptive\n","```\n","\n","✔ **Avoid unnecessary assignments:**  \n","```python\n","x = 5\n","x = x + 0  # Unnecessary, can be avoided\n","```\n","\n","✔ **Use unpacking where applicable:**  \n","```python\n","x, y, z = [10, 20, 30]  # Better than assigning individually\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Summary of Assignment Statements in Python**  \n","\n","| **Type** |
