By default, Python executes code **line by line, from top to bottom**. However, using **control flow statements**, we can **alter this sequence** to make decisions, repeat actions, or jump to specific parts of the program.  \n","\n","Think of control flow like **traffic signals** at an intersectionâ€”depending on the signal (red, yellow, or green), drivers take different actions. Similarly, in programming, control flow decides which part of the code should execute based on conditions.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Why is Control Flow Important?**  \n","\n","Without control flow, a program would execute all instructions sequentially, without making **decisions** or responding to different **conditions**. Control flow allows a program to:  \n","\n","- **Make decisions** â†’ Execute different code blocks based on conditions.  \n","- **Repeat actions** â†’ Run the same block of code multiple times.  \n","- **Handle complex logic** â†’ Manage different scenarios efficiently.  \n","\n","#### **Example Without Control Flow**  \n","```python\n","print(\"You are driving.\")\n","print(\"Traffic light is red.\")\n","print(\"Stop the car.\")\n","```\n","The program always follows the same steps, no matter the situation.  \n","\n","#### **Example With Control Flow (Decision Making)**  \n","```python\n","light = \"green\"\n","\n","if light == \"red\":\n","    print(\"Stop the car.\")\n","elif light == \"yellow\":\n","    print(\"Slow down.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Go!\")\n","```\n","The program **makes a decision** based on conditions.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Role of Control Flow in Decision Making**  \n","\n","Control flow enables **decision-making** in programs. Instead of executing every statement, the program checks **conditions** and decides **which statements to run**.  \n","\n","Consider a self-checkout system in a store:  \n","\n","- If the **total bill is greater than $100**, apply a **10% discount**.  \n","- If the **customer is a member**, give an **extra discount**.  \n","- Otherwise, charge the **full price**.  \n","\n","This decision-making process in programming is handled using **conditional statements** like `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else`.  \n","\n","#### **Example: Decision-Based Discount Calculation**\n","```python\n","total_bill = 120\n","\n","if total_bill > 100:\n","    print(\"You get a 10% discount!\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"No discount applied.\")\n","```\n","\n","The program makes a **decision** based on the total bill amount.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Real-World Applications of Control Flow**  \n","\n","Control flow is widely used in programming across different domains:  \n","\n","| **Application** | **Example** |\n","|---------------|------------|\n","| **Login System** | Checking if the username and password match before granting access. |\n","| **E-Commerce** | Applying discounts based on cart value or membership status. |\n","| **Game Development** | Determining whether a player wins or loses based on their score. |\n","| **Chatbots & AI** | Making decisions based on user input and responding accordingly. |\n","| **Traffic Lights** | Controlling signals based on sensor inputs. |\n","\n","#### **Example: Simple Login System Using Control Flow**  \n","```python\n","username = input(\"Enter username: \")\n","password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","\n","if username == \"admin\" and password == \"1234\":\n","    print(\"Login successful!\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Invalid credentials.
